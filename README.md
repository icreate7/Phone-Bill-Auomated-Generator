üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone or download this project.

Install dependencies:

pip install beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv


(Python‚Äôs smtplib, imaplib, email, time, and os are built-in, no need to install them.)

‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following:

EMAIL_TO_CHECK=your_email@gmail.com
APP_PASSWORD_01=your_app_password_for_inbox
IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com

EMAIL_TO_SEND=your_email@gmail.com
APP_PASSWORD_02=your_app_password_for_smtp


EMAIL_TO_CHECK: Gmail account to monitor for Vodafone bills

APP_PASSWORD_01: App password for inbox (generated in Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí App Passwords)

EMAIL_TO_SEND: Gmail account used to send reminders (can be the same as above)

APP_PASSWORD_02: App password for sending emails via SMTP

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use your real Gmail password. Always use App Passwords.

Add .env to .gitignore to prevent leaking credentials if using GitHub.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script:

python main.py


What it does:

Connects to Gmail inbox.

Searches for emails with subject "Vodafone".

Extracts bill details (account number, invoice number, balance, due date).

Prints the details in the console.

Sends a reminder email to yourself with these details.

Waits 15 days before checking again.

üìå Customization

Change the subject filter:

status, data = mail.search(None, '(SUBJECT "Vodafone")')


Replace "Vodafone" with another keyword if your email subject is different.

Adjust the frequency (currently every 15 days):

time.sleep(15 * 24 * 60 * 60)


For daily checks, change to:

time.sleep(24 * 60 * 60)
